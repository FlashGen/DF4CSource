README
This Flex 4 project contains the source files (and some additional components) 
created and discussed in the book "Developing Flex 4 Components" 
(http://tinyurl.com/flexcomponents).

As much as possible I've tried to place the sample files in chapter order and as 
such there is a single main MXML file for each chapter that has components or 
examples that can be run and examined. Obviously some chapters do not contain any 
code examples and therefore are omitted (Chapters 1, 2, 12 & 13 for example).

Due to the large volume of examples (and variants to illustrate nuances within 
the code) I have altered the package structure slightly and streamlined some of 
the examples and components used in the book. I haven't altered the underlying 
concepts or processes in doing so though. So you should still be able to see the 
functionality in practice within the included samples.

RUNNING THE CODE
Where applicable I've provided example code to make running the sample components 
as easy as possible. However you will still need to choose the correct chapter 
'application' file from the default src / (default package) folder to test them. 
If you are unsure how to do this just follow the instructions below:

1) Expand the src / (default folder) folder in the root of the project.
2) Right click on the file you wish to run - these all begin with 'ChapterXX.mxml' 
where XX is the chapter number.
3) When the context menu opens select 'Run Application'
4) The file should compile and run

FLASH AUTHORED COMPONENTS
If you are developing components using Flash Professional the example FLAs used 
in this book are located in the root of this project in a folder called 'assets'. 
Not to be confused with the 'assets' folder located within the 'src' directory.

Likewise all classes and their package structures used within these Flash 
Professional components are located within this folder as well. 

VERSIONING
All files in this project have been compiled and test using the Flex 4.0 SDK. I 
have tested these files as much as possible however bugs and accidental omissions  
do creep in. Where discovered I will endeavour to update the samples as soon as 
they are reported.

If there are a lot of changes any further releases will also contain a CHANGELOG 
indicating the type and level of changes.

WARNING
Throughout the samples I have used external CSS to apply simple formatting to the
screen. However Flash Builder produces a warning if a style is included but not
assigned. You will likely have noticed the plethora of 'warnings' when you 
imported the project in to your copy of Flash Builder. These are nothing to worry 
about and these can be safely ignored.

Should you have further questions please feel free to send any queries to:

While I can't answer individual emails I will try and provide articles and entries 
on my blog (http://blog.flashgen.com), so that anyone who has purchased my book 
can benefit from the answers and / or solutions.

Thank you for buying my book
